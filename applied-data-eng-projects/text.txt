Lionel Messi's individual achievements include eight Ballon d'Or awards, the most for any footballer. Having won 44 team trophies, he is the most decorated player in the history of professional football. His remarkable goal-scoring ability, high level playmaking and dribbling skills has earned him recognition as one of the greatest players in football history.
Messi's club career began with Barcelona, where he rose through the youth ranks, making his first-team debut in 2004. Over the next years, Messi became the club's all-time leading scorer, amassing numerous domestic and international accolades. During his tenure, Barcelona secured ten La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League trophies, among other titles. In August 2021, due to financial constraints faced by Barcelona, Messi transferred to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Joining forces with fellow superstars like Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, he won two Ligue 1 titles. In July 2023, Messi transferred to Inter Miami, leading the team to win the 2023 Leagues Cup, the club's first-ever trophy.
On the international stage, Messi made his debut with Argentina's senior national football team in 2005, and would represent the country in five FIFA World Cups, seven Copa Américas, and one Finalissima. Initially facing criticism for not winning major tournaments with the senior national team, Messi broke Argentina's 28-year international trophy drought by captaining the team to victory in the 2021 Copa América, the 2022 Finalissima, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and the 2024 Copa América.
